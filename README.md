Whats NostraPredict? 
    "NostraPredict" Has been derived from two words, "Nostradamus" and "Predict",
      Nostradamus was a French astrologer, physician, and reputed seer. Whats a SEER? well thats basicall someone who can predict the future(Like the one in VIKINGS)
    (And trust me, I didn't use GPT for this)
   
This is my first ever actual project, and its a work in progress(So is my ML Knowledge) Housing data prediction is a classic ML problem and I felt that this would be a good start in my journey.

PREVIEW OF "housing.csv:
  ~Housing prices is the first column followed Area, Bathrooms...Furnishing status. 
   Apart from numerical values, we have Yes/No (Which can be converted to Binary) and for furnishing status,
    There are three values, Furnished, Semi-Furnished and Unfurnished.
