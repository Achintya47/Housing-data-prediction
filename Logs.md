  Implemented Multiple regression on the housing prices. 4 Parameters have been used so far and the performance has increased. 
  The R2 Score for Linear Regression was around 0.2872931546811468 and for Polynomial Regression(degree 3) it was 0.32504534381488304

  For Multiple Regression, the R2 Score 0.5355960442835979 which shows that the multiple regression model is the most accurate so far

  Remapped the whole project using Pipeline feature from sklearn. Pipeline straeamlines the data so there is no need to individually Scale and Impute the data, Pipeline performs all the functions itself.
  The Mean_Absolute_Percentage_Error is 16% which is that good. Further, now multiple regression techniques will be applied and I will be comparing the scores of each one individually to find the perfect model.
